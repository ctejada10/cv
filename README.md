# Carlos' Curriculum Vitae

This is my comprehensive academic curriculim vitae, written in Latex. I tweaked [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) to include publication, and academic service info. 

## Build

All needed packages and files are included. Building should be straightforward.
