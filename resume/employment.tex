        quantitative and geo-spatial data using PowerBI and Apache Geoserver.
        \item Created a natural language processing pipeline to extract meaning
        from unstructured text, and transform it into a machine usable version.
        \item Implemented a model selection pipeline for determining the best
        machine learning model algorithm and parameters, depending on the
        incoming data.
        \item Regularly interacted with clients and translated their business
        requirements into application features.
